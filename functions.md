## Functions *Probably dive into functions after some practice with flow control.*In clojure functions are first class citizens and treated as data.```clojure; "Hello, world!"(def object "Hello, world!")(println object)``````clojure; (fn [params] expressions) (def object (fn [x] (println (str "x = " x))))(object "boo")```### Functions, functions, functions```clojure(def object (fn [x] (println (str "x = " x))))(object "Mario")```> Typically functions are declared using the defn macro.```clojure(defn object   "doc string"  [x]   (println (str "x = " x)))(object "Peach")```> Adding - to the end of defn makes the symbol scoped to the namespace. Adding - to the symbol name is a convention that allows you to know the scoping without looking at the declaration. ```clojure(defn- -object   "doc string"  [x]   (println (str "x = " x)))(object "Luigi")```> There is also a shorthand syntax typically used in conjunction with functions that take in other functions as parameters (such as map and reduce).```clojure#(println (str "x = " %))(#(println (str "x = " %)) "Toad")(#(println (str "x = " %1 " and " %2))```
