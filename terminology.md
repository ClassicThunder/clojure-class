## Terminology ### Expressions Lets take a look at how Clojure code looks. ```clojure(defn update-ticket-details  "Takes in update info from NCR ingest service and send back a  simple acknowledgment message."  [request]  (service/try-db   ;; Convert the batch to map and sort it by last updated   (let [batch (keywordize-keys                (json/read-str                 ((keyword "Batch Data") (:json-params request))))         batch-id ((keyword "Batch ID") (:json-params request))         sorted-batch (sort-by :timestamp batch)         all-events (-generate-diff request sorted-batch)]     (doseq [event all-events]       (if (some? event)         (log/info :msg (format "%s generated the following event %s"                                batch-id event))))     {:status 200      :body (flatten (filter some? all-events))})))```Each parenthesis pair is a expression. Expression can be nested.```clojure(...)```### FunctionsFunctions are applied to data. This is intentionally worded as such to differentiate from how most languages pass data into a function. ### Bindings In Clojure Data is bound to Symbols. In Clojure everything is treated as data.
